# LibrarySystemWithTxtDatabase
In this project I build “Library Management System” using object-oriented 
programming techniques. This program will use books.txt file that I created as a database 
where each line will represent a single book. At each line, book name, author, release date 
and number of pages will be kept and separated with a comma.

<ul>
  <li> I create a class named “Library”: </li>
  <p>   I open books.txt with “a+” mode, so that I can both read and append lines 
to the file. And also, if books.txt is not created previously, this mode will create 
the file. <br> </p>
  <li>  I add the following methods to library: </lu>
  <ul>
    <li> List Books </li>
    <li> Add Books </li>
    <li> Search Books </li>
    <li> Remove Books </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Create an object named “lib” with “Library” class. </li>
  <li>  Create a menu to interact with the “lib” object. </li>
  
</ul>
