# LibrarySystemWithTxtDatabase
In this project I build “Library Management System” using object-oriented 
programming techniques. This program will use books.txt file that I created as a database 
where each line will represent a single book. At each line, book name, author, release date 
and number of pages will be kept and separated with a comma.
<li>
  <lu> I create a class named “Library”: </lu>
  <p>   I open books.txt with “a+” mode, so that I can both read and append lines 
to the file. And also, if books.txt is not created previously, this mode will create 
the file.</p>
  <lu>  I add the following methods to library: </lu>
  <li>
    <lu> List Books </lu>
    <lu> Add Books </lu>
    <lu> Search Books </lu>
    <lu> Remove Books </lu>
  </li>
  <lu> Create an object named “lib” with “Library” class. </lu>
  <lu>  Create a menu to interact with the “lib” object. </lu>
  
</li>
